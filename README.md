# Secure Intrusion Detection System against DDoS Attack in Wireless Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET)

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a secure intrusion detection system (IDS) to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Wireless Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET).

## Abstract

Wireless Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are decentralized networks with no centralized controller, making them vulnerable to various security threats, including DDoS attacks. In this project, we investigate the impact of DDoS attacks on MANETs, focusing on parameters such as routing load, packet drop rate, and end-to-end delay. To address these challenges, we propose a secure IDS that detects and blocks DDoS attacks using Rate Limiting and Traffic Filtering Algorithm.

Wireless Mobile ad hoc network (MANET), Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dharun-maxie/IDS-In-Local-Ad-Hoc-Network.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r xx.txt
   ```

## Config VS to Run Code

To run the `DDProject.sln` file, you typically need to open it in Visual Studio or another compatible IDE that supports C# development. Here are the general steps:

1. **Open Visual Studio**: Launch Visual Studio or another IDE that supports C# development.

2. **Open Solution**: In Visual Studio, go to `File` > `Open` > `DDProject/...`, then navigate to the location of your `DDProject.sln` file and select it. This will open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. **Build Solution**: Once the solution is open, you can build it by going to `Build` > `Build Solution` or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`. This will compile all the projects within the solution.

4. **Run Projects**: After building the solution successfully, you can run individual projects within the solution by setting the desired project as the startup project (right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select `Set as Startup Project`), and then pressing `F5` to run it in debug mode or `Ctrl + F5` to run it without debugging.

If you need to automate build and run processes from the command line, you can use MSBuild, which is a command-line build tool that ships with Visual Studio. You would typically use MSBuild to build individual projects (`*.csproj`) within the solution rather than the solution file itself. Here's a basic example:

```bash
msbuild DDProject.csproj
```
